PiPineappleApplePi

This is a mock WiFi Pineapple, but built to be used on a normal raspberry-pi. I'm aiming to first have it usable, then quick to 
install to any device. The aim of this is to A) put to use the many pi's I have and B) give cool things to those without money.

[update]:
The stupid flipping thing (hostapd) does not want to work on my pi3b+. If anybody has any idea why it causes critical error on
startup (I can't start the gui anymore), I would love help.
